I now have the pleasure of transmitting to you as time an account as possible, which is killed and wounded 250—amongst the Prisoners Colonel Crawford2 -and some of the officers—amongst the killed is Major McClellan.3 Their officers I believe suffered much. Our loss is very inconsiderable, one Ranger kill’d, myself and two wounded—Levillier killed,4 four Indians killed & eight wounded. The white men that are wounded are in a good way and I hope will be fit for service in a fortnight.—The Delawares are still in pursuit, and I hope we will account for most of the six hundred. The Lake Indians are very tardy, we had but Forty-four of them, in the action—I should be glad they should hasten as I expect we will have occasion for them— I hope something will be done this summer—Clark I believe will soon be on his way for the Shawanese country; if so we will have occasion for as many as can possibly be gathered. The Indian Demands are great and I have not a single thing to suffice them with. I hope you’ll send us a fresh supply of ammunition, Tobacco and such other things as are necessary for warriors, are requisite if you please to send them. The. Chief with one Eye and Dewantate3 with their Bands are going to Detroit, as it is their custom after striking a blow’ to return & see their Families; but whatever you may tell them they will do with pleasure. They behaved very well w’hilst with me. Sindewattone your friend the little old chief remains with me, I find him very useful as he seems willing to do every thing in his power for the good of the service, and of great service to me and a better soldier never went into the field. I received a Ball through both my legs wrhich obliged me to leave the field. If I had not been so unlucky I am induced to think, from the influence I have with the Indians the Enemy w’ould not have left the place we surrounded them in.

After some difficulty the Lake Indians were prevailed upon to turn their course this way, and are now upon their march hither. I arrived here last night, and this day about two o’clock a Runner came in from the Lower villages with an account that another Scout which had been sent out after the arrival of the one mentioned, was returned & had discovered the Enemy on their march below the Big Bone Lick & that they had dispatched three of\\n',\n",

And that three days ago upon crossing the Ohio near the mouth of the Big Miamies River, they again discovered a Body of the Enemy who they suppose to be an advanced Party, that has either fallen in upon their Tracks, or ware come to take Post till the arrival of their main army &c. The Chiefs of the lower Villages inform as they have already sent messengers to the Wabash Indians & all those of the neighbour hood of the Miamis to desire their assistance as soon as possible and request all who have gone back to Detroit to come out as they may still be in time either to reinforce us or pursue the Enemy or as occasion may require. They say they are now about two hundred and fifty men there and determined to meet the Enemy before they arrive in their neighbour hood, therefore desire to be Joined with all speed by the rest of their Brethren. Captain Caldwell will be here early tomorrow with the Lake Indians and this Evening the Indians of Those Towns are to be assembled to determine upon going forward. There is several Parties gone to endeavor to discover farther Intelligence & hope it will arrive in time to go by this opportunity.\\n',\n",

       " 'My Letters of the 22d & 23rd July informed you of the reports brought us of the Enemy’s motions at that time, which was delivered by the Chiefs of the Standing Stone Village,1 and confirmed by Belts & Strings of Wampum in so earnest a manner, that could not but gain credit with us. We had upon the occasion the greatest Body of Indians collected to an advantageous piece of ground near the Piccawa2 village, that have been assembled in this Quarter since the commencement of the war, and perhaps may never be in higher spirits to engage the Enemy, when the return of scouts from the Ohio informed us that the accounts we had received were false, this disappointment notwithstanding all our endeavours to keep them together occasioned them to disperse in disgust with each other. The Inhabitants of this country who were the most immediately interested in keeping in a Body were the first that broke off, and tho’ we advanc’d towards the Ohio with upwards of three hundred Hurons and Lake Indians, few of the Delawares Shawanese or Mingoes followed us. On our arrival at the Ohio we remained still in uncertainty with respect to the Enemy’s motions, and it was thought best from hence to send scouts to the Falls, and that the main Body should advance into the Enemy’s country, and endeavour to lead out a Party from some of their Forts by which . we might be able to gain some certain Intelligence. Accordingly we crossed the Ohio and arrived the 18th Inst, at one of the Eenemy’s Settlements call’d Bryant’s Station, but the Indians discovering their numbers prevented their coming out, and the Lake Indians finding this, rush’d up to the Fort and set several out Houses on Fire, but at too great a distance to touch the Fort, the wind blowing the contrary way. The firing continued this day, during which time a Party of about twenty of the Enemy approached a part which happened not to be guarded, and about one half of them reached it, the rest being drove back by a few Indians who were near the place. The next morning finding it to no purpose to keep up a fire longer upon the Fort as we were getting men killed, & had already several men wounded which were to be carried. The Indians determined to retreat, and on the 20h reached the Blue Licks,8 where we encamp’d near an advantageous Hill & expecting the Enemy would pursue, determined here to wait for ’em, keeping spies at the Lick, who on the morning of the 21st dis covering them, and at half past seven o’clock we engaged them and\\n',\n",

       " 'totally defeated them in a short time. We were not much superior to them in numbers, they being about 200 pick’d men from the Settlement of Kentucky commanded by the Colonels Todd,1 Trigg, Boone, and Todd with the Majors Harlin and McGeary, most of whom fell in the action. From the best inquiry I could make upon the spot, there was upwards of one hundred & Forty kill’d and taken, with near one hundred Rifles—several being thrown into a deep River that were not recovered. It was said by the Prisoners that a Colonel Logan1 was expected to join them with one hundred men more; we waited upon the ground this day for him, but seeing there was not much probability of his coming, we set off and crossed the Ohio the second day after the action. Capt. Caldwell and I arrived at this place last night with a design of sending some assistance to those who are bringing the wounded People, who are fourteen in number. We had ten Indians killed with Mr. La Bute of the Indian Dept who by sparing the life of one of the Enemy and endeavouring to take him Prisoner lost his own.\\n',\n",
       " 'To our disappointment we find no Provisions brought forward to this place, or likelihood of any for some time, and we have entirely subsisted since we left this on what we got in the woods and took from the Enemy.\\n',\n",
       " 'The Prisoners all agree in their account that there is no talk of any Expedition from that Quarter, nor indeed are they able without assistance from the Colonies, and that the Militia of the country have been employed during the summer in building the Fort at the Falls, and what they call a Row Galley, which has made one trip up the River to the mouth of the big Miamis, and occasioned that alarm which created us so much trouble. She carries one six pounder, six 4 pounders, & two 2 pounders, and rows eighty oars—she had at the big bone Lick one hundred men, but being chiefly draughts from the Militia, many of ’em left her on different parts of the River. One of the Prisoners mentions the arrival of Boats lately from Fort Pitt, and that Letters has pass’d between the Commanding officer of that place and Mr. Clarke, intimating that preparation is making there for another Expedition in the Indian Country. We have since our arrival heard something of this matter and that the particulars has been forwarded to you—A Detachment of Rangers with a large Party of Delawares and Shawanese are gone that way, who will be able to discover the truth of this matter.\\n',\n",
